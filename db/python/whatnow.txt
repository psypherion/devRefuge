# 13. What Now?[¶](#what-now "Link to this heading")

Reading this tutorial has probably reinforced your interest in using Python — you should be eager to apply Python to solving your real-world problems. Where should you go to learn more?

This tutorial is part of Python’s documentation set. Some other documents in the set are:

  * [The Python Standard Library](../library/index.html#library-index):

You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard library. The standard Python distribution includes a _lot_ of additional code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate random numbers, parse command-line options, compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of what’s available.

  * [Installing Python Modules](../installing/index.html#installing-index) explains how to install additional modules written by other Python users.

  * [The Python Language Reference](../reference/index.html#reference-index): A detailed explanation of Python’s syntax and semantics. It’s heavy reading, but is useful as a complete guide to the language itself.




More Python resources:

  * <https://www.python.org>: The major Python web site. It contains code, documentation, and pointers to Python-related pages around the web.

  * <https://docs.python.org>: Fast access to Python’s documentation.

  * <https://pypi.org>: The Python Package Index, previously also nicknamed the Cheese Shop [[1]](#id2), is an index of user-created Python modules that are available for download. Once you begin releasing code, you can register it here so that others can find it.

  * <https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/>: The Python Cookbook is a sizable collection of code examples, larger modules, and useful scripts. Particularly notable contributions are collected in a book also titled Python Cookbook (O’Reilly & Associates, ISBN 0-596-00797-3.)

  * <https://pyvideo.org> collects links to Python-related videos from conferences and user-group meetings.

  * <https://scipy.org>: The Scientific Python project includes modules for fast array computations and manipulations plus a host of packages for such things as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, non-linear solvers, random number distributions, statistical analysis and the like.




For Python-related questions and problem reports, you can post to the newsgroup _comp.lang.python_ , or send them to the mailing list at python-list@python.org. The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed, so messages posted to one will automatically be forwarded to the other. There are hundreds of postings a day, asking (and answering) questions, suggesting new features, and announcing new modules. Mailing list archives are available at <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/>.

Before posting, be sure to check the list of [Frequently Asked Questions](../faq/index.html#faq-index) (also called the FAQ). The FAQ answers many of the questions that come up again and again, and may already contain the solution for your problem.

Footnotes

“Cheese Shop” is a Monty Python’s sketch: a customer enters a cheese shop, but whatever cheese he asks for, the clerk says it’s missing.
