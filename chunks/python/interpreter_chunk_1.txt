# 2. Using the Python Interpreter[¶](#using-the-python-interpreter "Link to this heading")

## 2.1. Invoking the Interpreter[¶](#invoking-the-interpreter "Link to this heading")

The Python interpreter is usually installed as `/usr/local/bin/python3.13` on those machines where it is available; putting `/usr/local/bin` in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:

```

    
    
    python3.13
    
```

to the shell. [[1]](#id2) Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., `/usr/local/python` is a popular alternative location.)

On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the [Microsoft Store](../using/windows.html#windows-store), the `python3.13` command will be available. If you have the [py.exe launcher](../using/windows.html#launcher) installed, you can use the `py` command. See [Excursus: Setting environment variables](../using/windows.html#setting-envvars) for other ways to launch Python.

Typing an end-of-file character (``Control`-`D`` on Unix, ``Control`-`Z`` on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: `quit()`.

The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support the [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing ``Control`-`P`` to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix [Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution](interactive.html#tut-interacting) for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if `^P` is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.

The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a _script_ from that file.

A second way of starting the interpreter is `python -c command [arg] ...`, which executes the statement(s) in _command_ , analogous to the shell’s [`-c`](../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) option.
