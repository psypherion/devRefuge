# 16. Appendix[¶](#appendix "Link to this heading")

## 16.1. Interactive Mode[¶](#interactive-mode "Link to this heading")

There are two variants of the interactive [REPL](../glossary.html#term-REPL). The classic basic interpreter is supported on all platforms with minimal line control capabilities.

On Windows, or Unix-like systems with [`curses`](../library/curses.html#module-curses "curses: An interface to the curses library, providing portable terminal handling. \(Unix\)") support, a new interactive shell is used by default. This one supports color, multiline editing, history browsing, and paste mode. To disable color, see [Controlling color](../using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color) for details. Function keys provide some additional functionality. `F1` enters the interactive help browser [`pydoc`](../library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system."). `F2` allows for browsing command-line history with neither output nor the [>>>](../glossary.html#term-0) and […](../glossary.html#term-...) prompts. `F3` enters “paste mode”, which makes pasting larger blocks of code easier. Press `F3` to return to the regular prompt.

When using the new interactive shell, exit the shell by typing `exit` or `quit`. Adding call parentheses after those commands is not required.

If the new interactive shell is not desired, it can be disabled via the [`PYTHON_BASIC_REPL`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_BASIC_REPL) environment variable.

### 16.1.1. Error Handling[¶](#error-handling "Link to this heading")

When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing the stack trace. (Exceptions handled by an [`except`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#except) clause in a [`try`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement are not errors in this context.) Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit status; this applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output.

Typing the interrupt character (usually ``Control`-`C`` or `Delete`) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the primary prompt. [[1]](#id2) Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises the [`KeyboardInterrupt`](../library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") exception, which may be handled by a [`try`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement.
