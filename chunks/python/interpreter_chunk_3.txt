To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.

To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the _first_ line of the file. The syntax is as follows:

```

    
    
    # -*- coding: encoding -*-
    
```

where _encoding_ is one of the valid [`codecs`](../library/codecs.html#module-codecs "codecs: Encode and decode data and streams.") supported by Python.

For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:

```

    
    
    # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
    
```

One exception to the _first line_ rule is when the source code starts with a [UNIX “shebang” line](appendix.html#tut-scripts). In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:

```

    
    
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
    
```

[[1](#id1)]

On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named `python`, so that it does not conflict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.
