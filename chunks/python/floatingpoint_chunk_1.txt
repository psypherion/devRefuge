# 15. Floating-Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations[¶](#floating-point-arithmetic-issues-and-limitations "Link to this heading")

Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions. For example, the **decimal** fraction `0.625` has value 6/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000, and in the same way the **binary** fraction `0.101` has value 1/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have identical values, the only real difference being that the first is written in base 10 fractional notation, and the second in base 2.

Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. A consequence is that, in general, the decimal floating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine.

The problem is easier to understand at first in base 10. Consider the fraction 1/3. You can approximate that as a base 10 fraction:

```

    
    
    0.3
    
```

or, better,

```

    
    
    0.33
    
```

or, better,

```

    
    
    0.333
    
```

and so on. No matter how many digits you’re willing to write down, the result will never be exactly 1/3, but will be an increasingly better approximation of 1/3.

In the same way, no matter how many base 2 digits you’re willing to use, the decimal value 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a base 2 fraction. In base 2, 1/10 is the infinitely repeating fraction

```

    
    
    0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011...
    
```

Stop at any finite number of bits, and you get an approximation. On most machines today, floats are approximated using a binary fraction with the numerator using the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit and with the denominator as a power of two. In the case of 1/10, the binary fraction is `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55` which is close to but not exactly equal to the true value of 1/10.

Many users are not aware of the approximation because of the way values are displayed. Python only prints a decimal approximation to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine.
